# 12rulestolearntocode

### I frequently hear questions like **"What should they learn first?"** </br> **Which programming language is the most important to learn?** </br> **Which course and tutorials are the greatest to follow?** **Is it time for me to give up programming?** and a lot more... 
</br>

### as well as expressions like </br> 
**"Ughhhh, I don't understand!"** and **"I have no idea what I'm doing!"** </br> 
_**Does it make sense to learn ( this technology )?**_
</br>

 **I don't think I'm getting any better at programming.**

 </br>

## I request you to read this book, which is only of 35 pages but trust me </br>
**you won't ask yourself these harsh and demotivating questions.**



## Before Starting : 
Take out some time, take a bottle of a water, keep your phones away ( unless you'll be reading on it ), pause the music, grab a note and pen, start reading this.
